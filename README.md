Hi there!  My name is Anita Wright, and this is my portfolio website.  I've started with just the bare bones, but within the coming weeks, I plan to make adjustments to the portfolio and to add projects that I am working on.  

As I make these additions, I will push them to Github, and add them as projects in the spaces listed on the portfolio.  

Not only will this allow me a space to practice new skills, it will also provide me with something I can use to show off those skills once I've created something with them.
